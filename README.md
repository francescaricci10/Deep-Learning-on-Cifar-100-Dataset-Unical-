In this project, a Deep Learning model is developed using the Keras library with TensorFlow as the backend. 

The main objective is the automatic classification of images from the CIFAR-100 dataset, a widely recognized benchmark in the field of computer vision.
The CIFAR-100 dataset contains 60,000 color images of size 32x32 pixels, divided into 100 distinct classes, each comprising 600 images. 
The dataset is organized into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes span a broad range of visual categories, including animals, vehicles, 
and both natural and artificial objects.

Compared to the simpler CIFAR-10, this dataset presents greater complexity due to the high number of classes, the small image size, and the potential visual 
similarity between certain categories. These characteristics make CIFAR-100 a particularly suitable choice for evaluating the generalization and discrimination 
capabilities of deep neural network models.
